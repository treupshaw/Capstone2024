# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## Introduction :globe_with_meridians:

This presentation will explore the **emerging market of web3**, highlighting its significance as a new frontier for digital transactions, decentralized applications (DApps), and blockchain technology. Web3 is rapidly transforming how businesses interact with technology and each other, representing a significant shift from traditional centralized systems to decentralized, user-controlled networks.

In the rapidly evolving web3 market, making informed decisions based on accurate and timely data is crucial. **Data-driven decision-making** enables businesses to identify trends, gauge market demand, and anticipate future challenges in the web3 space.

The primary goals are to elucidate the potential of web3 for business innovation, demonstrate how **business intelligence (BI) techniques** can be applied to web3 data for strategic advantages, and equip the audience with the knowledge to leverage web3 technologies in their operations.

## Presentation Candidate :man_technologist:

My name is **Tre Upshaw** — a 27-year-old Air Force veteran, student, father, and digital entrepreneur. 

I'm self-employed with years of experience in both e-commerce and web3 markets, and have been developing my talents in both data analytics and business intelligence.
Proficient in tools such as **PowerBI, SQL, Excel/PowerQuery, Python, and SSRS** — I have a solid background in analyzing complex datasets and translating insights into actionable strategies.

## Data Selection :file_folder:

The dataset selection will focus on the emerging market of web3 through a variety of sources such as exchange inflows, transaction volumes, decentralized finance (DeFi) trends, and user adoption rates. Criteria include **data reliability, relevance to current market trends**, and potential to provide insights into future developments.

Data will be sourced from **Kaggle**, renowned for its comprehensive and diverse datasets related to various aspects of the web3 ecosystem, including cryptocurrency market trends, DeFi analytics, and up-to-date blockchain transaction data.

This data will provide a foundation for understanding the web3 market dynamics, identifying growth opportunities, and assessing risks, directly impacting strategic business decisions in the digital and decentralized marketplaces.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration :bar_chart:

The presentation will cover **data visualization, trend analysis, predictive modeling, and network analysis** techniques tailored to the web3 data.

Utilizing **PowerBI** for dynamic data visualization, **Python** for data preprocessing and modeling, and **SQL** for data querying and aggregation, the process will involve transforming raw data into insightful, actionable intelligence.

Insights into market trends, investment hotspots, user behavior patterns, and potential regulatory impacts will be discussed. These insights will inform risk management, investment decisions, and strategic planning for businesses interested in the web3 space.

## Implementation Plan :calendar:

A **four-week timeline**, with the first week dedicated to data collection and preprocessing, the second and third weeks to analysis and visualization development, and the final week to refining the presentation based on rehearsals and feedback.

**PowerBI** for report generation, **Python** and **SQL** for data analysis, and **Kaggle datasets**. Collaboration with other web3 analysts for peer reviews and insights, including an additional feedback session in the third week with a focus group comprising web3 experts and potential business stakeholders to refine the presentation's content and delivery.

## Conclusion :end:

This presentation aims to demystify the web3 market, showcase how business intelligence can unveil strategic insights, and foster an environment of informed decision-making for businesses venturing into web3.

Attendees will be encouraged to explore web3 opportunities and apply BI techniques to their strategic planning processes, ensuring they remain at the forefront of digital innovation.
